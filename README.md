## Description ##
OREO's (Optimization of Real Estate Options and Sales) aims to create a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way real estate investments are made, making it 
more accessible to a wider range of investors. The platform will allow users to invest in fractions of real estate properties through tokens, enabling fractional ownership 
and democratizing real estate investment.

## Blockchain Component ##
Asset Tokenization: Blockchain enables fractional ownership of real estate assets through tokenization, making real estate investment more accessible.
Transparency and Security: Immutable property records on the blockchain ensure transparency and security, reducing the risk of fraud.
Automated Transactions: Smart contracts streamline real estate transactions, reducing costs and accelerating the process.
Global Accessibility: Blockchain opens real estate investment to a global audience, attracting diverse investors.
Reduced Administrative Overheads: Blockchain reduces administrative costs, making real estate investments more cost-efficient.
Data Security: Blockchain ensures data security and privacy for user information and transaction history.

## AI Component ##
Property Valuation: AI models assess property values using historical data, market trends, and property details, helping investors make informed decisions.
Rental Income Estimation: AI predicts rental income potential based on property characteristics, location, and market demand, assisting users in assessing income prospects.
Risk Assessment: AI-driven risk assessment considers market volatility, economic indicators, and property-specific risks, enabling users to understand investment risks.
Property Management: Implement AI-driven property management tools that assist in property maintenance scheduling, tenant screening, and rental management.
Predictive Analytics: AI models use predictive analytics to forecast real estate market trends, aiding users in making informed buying, selling, and holding decisions
